\section*{Ethics Statement}
This paper contributes to advancing Foundation Models by augmenting language models with Code Interpreter and Search tools via test-time scaling, which has strong potential to improve performance and alignment with human preferences. However, such capabilities are inherently dual-use, the same techniques that augment models toward harmless outputs can, with minor changes, be misused to generate harmful content. While misuse is a concern, we believe the broader societal benefits outweigh the risks.

\section*{Reproducibility Statement} For better reproducibility, we include detailed descriptions of 15 pre-designed agents and 15 LLM-generated agents in Table~\ref{tab:agent_variants} and Table~\ref{tab:baseline_agents}. The prompts of all agents are in Appendix~Sec.~\ref{appendix section: Prompts of TUMIX}. The complete algorithm of \texttt{TUMIX} is illustrated in Appendix~Sec.~\ref{appendix section: Algorithm of TUMIX}. Our code and dataset will be made publicly available under an open-source license following the acceptance of the paper.

\section*{Large Language Model Usage for Writing}\quad
In this paper, we use LLMs---specifically \texttt{Gemini} and \texttt{ChatGPT}---as general-purpose writing aids. Draft text was provided to these models for grammatical correction and structural refinement, after which the output was verified and further edited when necessary. Their use was strictly limited to text refinement; they were not employed to generate new content or references.
